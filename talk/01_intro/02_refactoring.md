# Refactoring

!SLIDE

# No one writes perfect code
## on the first try

!SLIDE

# Make changes without affecting functionality

!SLIDE

# How do you know?

!SLIDE

# Manually
## Tiresome â€“ makes you less likely to do it

!SLIDE

# Automated
## Write it once, never think about it again

!SLIDE

## Scenario:
# Creating a to do item

!SLIDE

* Open a browser
* Navigate to the page
* Fill in the description
* Press create
* Check that it was created correctly

!SLIDE

# Do that every time
## vs.
# Write it once

!SLIDE

# Not to mention:
## Sometimes manual testing is really hard

!SLIDE

## Scenario:
# Calculating total price
# of an order

!SLIDE

* Calculate price for each line item
* Add line item prices
* Check for bulk discounts and subtract
* Redeem vouchers
* Reimburse refunds
* Add shipping costs
* Add taxes

!SLIDE

# Good luck
## doing that in your head

!SLIDE

# Good luck
## doing this through the UI

!SLIDE

# Impossibly large
## combination of possibilities

!SLIDE

## Once code is written
# it will never be changed

!SLIDE

# Legacy code
